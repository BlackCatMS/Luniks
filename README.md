# Luniks | 
Luniksian is a spoken language which is mostly spoken in the Thórirsant and Kérisant area of the planet Luniks. Already too much info? This repository, or rather note collection, collects all that had happened on this planet, and tries to put it into a somewhat comprehensible set of words, so everyone else can dive deep into the unknown together with me.
